    <h2>Goals:</h2>
    <p>
      My goal for this coding class, is obviously to learn coding, but to help me understand more about what the current web company that I work at does, but to also hopefully pave a path for a new career. I am hoping to take from this class enough coding techniques/skills to jump into a developer position after completing.

    <h3>Concerns:</h3>
    <p>
      Working for a Web Design/SEO company my curiousity for web design is normal. My dad is also a Web developer over at CMD Agency. It makes sense to be drawn naturally to this feild. My main concern is that I will not only understand it, which will be frustrating because I am a very quick learner and most things come easy to me. But not only that, but that I will not really like coding. I worry that I have this great opportunity and I won't want it. I am walking into this class not ever done any coding in my life. And I hope I can make beautiful responsive websites, because my job now is to look up online local businesses who's websites need help whether it be it's not responsive, out of date, mobile capable, and where they appear on the popular search engines. Therefore I hope to be able to make websites that would pass my current job's screening.
